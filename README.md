### Hi, I'm Alaina! 👋🏻

I'm a first-year student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute majoring in Computer Science, with a particular interest in programming languages and operating systems.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - [Olly](https://github.com/alythical/olly), a game client and server for the two-player strategy board game, [Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi)
  - [alainacn.dev](https://github.com/alythical/alainacn.dev), my personal website where I write about tech and anything else that interests me
  - **previous work**:
      - [kyanite](https://github.com/alythical/kyanite), a toy compiled programming language
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Julia](https://julialang.org), and I'm interested in learning functional languages like [Haskell](https://haskell.org)
